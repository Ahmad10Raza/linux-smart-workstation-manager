## Configuration

1. **Customizing Modes** : Each mode script is located in the `modes/` folder. You can modify these scripts to better fit your workflow.
2. **Config File** : The main configuration file is `config/smartwmrc`. You can modify:

* Default editor (e.g., `code`, `vim`, `nano`)
* Default browser (e.g., `firefox`, `chrome`)
* PDF viewer (e.g., `evince`)
* Other preferences such as project directories, etc.

1. **Usage Stats** : The usage stats are logged in `logs/usage_stats.log`. You can review your productivity in the `stats.sh` script or manually check the log.

## Usage

SmartWM supports the following modes:

* **Coding** : Sets up your editor and workspace for coding.
* **Browsing** : Opens research and work-related websites in your browser.
* **Research** : Opens your research folder, websites, and academic PDFs.

To launch a mode, run:

```bash
smartwm <mode_name>
```

Where `<mode_name>` can be `coding`, `browsing`, or `research`.

Additionally, you can restore your last used mode:

```bash
smartwm restore
```

### Voice Command Mode

To launch SmartWM with voice commands, use:

```bash
smartwm voice
```

This will listen for commands like "coding", "browsing", and "research" to trigger the respective modes.

### Break Reminder

```bash
smartwm break
```
